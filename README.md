### A little about me...
Why a Bachelors Degree in Physics (?)  
Curiousity is what made me fall into this degree plan. Out of highschool I had intended on achieving a Math degree, which soon changed to Chemistry when I had taken Chem I and II as my science electives in community college. This then turned into taking O-Chem I & II, in which I learnt that the chemistry taught there is mostly carbon based. The knowledge of what the smallest building block surely could not just stop there; there must be something smaller. This is what made me decide on the degree.  
  
What do you want to do with a degree in Physics (?)  
Explore experimentally and theoretically new detection techniques or manipulation of materials to do tasks that I would need to or want to do. This is not limited to the application type. I want to be able to find multiple ways of finding a solution using known or new physical phenomena. Particularly I am interested in instrumentation types and modularity. Things that I craft have to be both efficient and reusable for me to consider them a true success. Failing at doing so is a smaller success and a huge learning experience.
