## A little more about me and my thoughts
ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I am currently studying for a **Bachelors' Degree in Physics with a Minor in Mathematics** Instruments in fields have always been an eye catcher to me, working in any field that allows me to create tools that can facilitate production, efficiency, or any tasks is something that I constantly think on. 
- Is what I am doing the most efficient (?)  
Likely not, feedback is something I value as I can never know if what I truly do is the best. Project direction helps, and if I am asked to attempt a different route experimentally; I will.  
- Is what I create new?  
I wish! A lot of what I craft is made with bits and pieces of what I have observed or it is a simple solution to whatever task I am trying to innovate on.
